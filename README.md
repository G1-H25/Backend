### Project description

This repo will represent the backend (such as API, Server and Database) part of the project where we will handle the communication between the devices and users.  
Our goal is to develop a structured API with the ASP.NET core while using a GitHub Actions workflow.  
The server is going to be hosted on Azure cloud services where we also will use the AzureSQL for our database.  
We are going to summarize our last course (DevOps) using technologies like GitHub Actions to create a robust, secure and automatic workflow.
